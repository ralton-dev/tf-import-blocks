# tf-import-blocks

Terraform `import` blocks for resources you have but your configuration does not.

**A resource's Terraform identity is a `(type, import-id)` pair produced by a
per-type rule — not its AWS id.** `aws_sqs_queue` imports by queue URL,
`aws_lambda_function` by function name, `aws_ecs_service` by
`cluster-name/service-name`, and `aws_route`'s state id is a synthetic hash that
is never a valid import id at all. Enough types work by accident that a naive
"use the `id`" generator looks correct on a demo and silently emits garbage for
the composite and attachment resources that make up the bulk of a real state.

The rule table in `src/rules/` is this package's asset. The entry points are thin
adapters onto it that differ only in what they can feed it.

| entry point | source | what it has |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `importsFromState(json, label)` | a Terraform state file | real attributes, so composite ids are computable exactly |
| `resolveScanned(subject)` | a scanned AWS resource | only a snapshot, so composite ids must be reconstructed |
| `resolveScannedExpanded(subject)` | the same | plus the terraform resources the snapshot keeps *inside* that one — see [Nested resources](#nested-resources--one-scanned-parent-several-import-blocks) |

Where a type supports both, the two **must produce the same string**.
`test/golden.test.ts` asserts it.

Source comments, tests and fixtures here cite numbered design decisions —
"decision 5", "decision 9". They are defined in
[Design decisions](#design-decisions) at the foot of this file, numbered to
match, and there is nowhere else to look them up.

## Install

```
npm install tf-import-blocks
```

ESM only, Node 20 or newer, **no runtime dependencies**. TypeScript
declarations ship with the package; there is no `@types/` to install.

Moving resources between states — you have a state file, you want the `import`
blocks that adopt its resources into another configuration:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { emitBlocks, importsFromState } from 'tf-import-blocks';

const state = JSON.parse(readFileSync('terraform.tfstate', 'utf8'));
process.stdout.write(emitBlocks(importsFromState(state, 'terraform.tfstate')));
```

```hcl
# account 111122223333 · region eu-west-1
import {
  to = aws_sqs_queue.orders
  id = "https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/111122223333/orders"
}
```

Note the id: `aws_sqs_queue` imports by queue **URL**, and the state's `id`
attribute is the ARN. That gap, across ~250 resource types, is what this package
is for.

Adopting drift — you have a resource discovered by a scanner and no state entry
for it at all, so there are no attributes to read:

```ts
import { emitBlock, resolveScanned } from 'tf-import-blocks';

const block = emitBlock(
  resolveScanned({
    kind: 'sqs-queue',
    id: 'arn:aws:sqs:eu-west-1:111122223333:orders',
    region: 'eu-west-1',
    accountId: '111122223333',
    raw: {},
  }),
);
```

`resolveScanned` always answers — a kind with no rule produces a `# VERIFY`
block rather than nothing (decision 5), so a bulk emit never silently loses a
resource. `ResolvedImport.verified` tells you which you got.

## Build and test

```
npm install     # `prepare` builds dist/ — the package is consumed built, never from src/
npm run build   # tsc -p tsconfig.build.json  → dist/, with .d.ts and source maps
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

`dist/` is gitignored and rebuilt on every install. `exports` points at
`dist/index.js` with no fallback to source, so a missing build fails loudly
rather than quietly resolving TypeScript a consumer cannot compile.

## Deliberately dependency-free

This package has **no runtime dependencies** — not an HCL library, not a YAML
parser. The emitter is string building (decision 13), and the rule table is
data.

It also imports nothing from `@atlas/*`, the private packages of the AWS estate
scanner it was written inside and which several source comments still name
(decision 1). That was never a courtesy: the structural `ScannedSubject` in
`src/types.ts` exists precisely so that scanner's `ResourceRef` satisfies it
without a converter, and any other producer's record can too. Do not
"simplify" it by reaching into a caller's types.

Decision 1 also predicted that lifting the package into its own repository would
be `git mv` plus a `package.json`. **That was wrong**, and the record is worth
keeping: it additionally took a separate build config (the monorepo base set
`noEmit`), an `exports` repoint from `src/index.ts` to `dist/`, `tsx`,
`typescript` and `@types/node` as explicit devDependencies rather than ones
hoisted from a sibling, and a new test glob. The atlas-free half of the decision
held perfectly; the "it's just a move" half did not.

## Only identifiers leave the state file

Rules may **read** any attribute to compute an import id. The emitter writes
only the computed id, the Terraform address, and the account and region the
resource's own ARN disclosed. No attribute value is ever copied into output
unless it *is* the import id. Reading a state to compute an import id does not
put state values in the generated `.tf`.

There is no `provider =` argument in the output — we cannot know your alias
names. Each block carries a `# account <id> · region <region>` comment instead,
because importing into the wrong provider is silent and expensive.

## Unknown types are emitted, never dropped

A type with no rule still gets a block, built from the state's own `id` and
flagged:

```hcl
# VERIFY: no rule for aws_s3_object — import id may not be the state id
import {
  to = aws_s3_object.weird
  id = "acme-assets-eu-west-1/reports/\"q1\"/$${env}/summary.txt"
}
```

Silently skipping a resource during a state move is the worst possible failure;
a wrong-but-flagged block is recoverable. The same applies when a rule exists
but cannot compute an id from the attributes it was given — it says so rather
than guessing.

Escaping is the emitter's job and is not optional: `\` → `\\`, `"` → `\"`,
`${` → `$${` and `%{` → `%%{`. S3 keys, tag values and Route 53 record names all
contain these in the wild, and an unescaped `${` is interpolated by Terraform at
parse time.

## The two shapes of state rule, and why they differ

`src/rules/state.ts` writes rules in one of two shapes, and the difference is
load-bearing:

- **Single-attribute imports** read the documented attribute and fall back to
  the state `id`. The fallback is safe because for these types the provider's
  own `SetId` *is* that attribute — `sqs/queue.go` is `SetId(QueueUrl)` and
  `lambda/function.go` is `SetId(functionName)`, so on the state path plain
  passthrough was already right for both. Naming `url` and `function_name`
  documents *why* it works rather than leaving it to luck. (On the **scanned**
  path those two are wrong, because atlas stores the ARN. That is the other
  half of the rule table's job.)
- **Composite imports** compose strictly and return `undefined` when a part is
  missing — **no `id` fallback at all**. For `aws_route`,
  `aws_security_group_rule`, `aws_ecs_service` and the `aws_wafv2_*` family the
  state id is a synthetic hash or an ARN, a different string entirely, so
  falling back would emit a confident wrong answer. An honest `# VERIFY` is
  recoverable; a plausible wrong id is not.

Three attribute readers exist for reasons worth knowing before you write a rule:

| helper | why |
| --- | --- |
| `str()` (exported from `types.ts`) | the default: a non-empty string |
| `scalar()` | `from_port` is a number and `egress` a boolean, and both are parts of documented ids. `0` and `false` are values, not absences |
| `text()` | `str()` rejects `''`, and a Route 53 apex record imports as `Z4KAPRWWNC7JR__NS` — double underscore and all |
| `bareName()` | `aws_ecs_service.cluster` holds the cluster **ARN** while the import id wants `prod-cluster`. Applied to IAM attachment principals for the same reason |

## Coverage — atlas kinds (from a scanned resource)

**136 of the 139 `kind` values the viewer can build resolve to a rule.** This is
the figure the details panel and the bulk copy depend on, and it is a different
question from the terraform-type count below rather than a restatement of it.
The two overlap in 105 types and neither contains the other: 31 rules are
scanned-only, and the composite and attachment types that dominate a real state
file are never drawn on a graph.

"Kind" is the vocabulary of the estate scanner this package was written inside
(see [Design decisions](#design-decisions), decision 1). That scanner is not
public and the file paths below are unfollowable from here — they are kept
because they name *where the number came from*, and a figure with no derivation
is a figure nobody can re-check. If you are producing subjects from your own
inventory rather than that one, `coveredKinds()` is the same set from inside the
package and needs no external repository.

**Derive this figure; do not count it by hand.** `kind` is assigned by four
separate routes in the viewer's `data.ts` — the local `add()` helper, the
`globalKinds` table, three inline `all.push` calls for `zone`, `dxgw` and `s3`,
and the `generic` literal. A regex over `add('…')` sees only the first: it finds
117 kinds of which all but `ecr-registry` resolve, and so reports **99.1%
against a true 97.8%** — flattering, because two of the three unresolved kinds
are assigned by routes it cannot see. (117 + 21 from `globalKinds` + 4 inline
literals = 142, less the three WAF kinds the viewer builds both regionally and
globally = 139.) The reliable method executes the builder rather than reading
it, and so cannot miss a route:

1. Fill every collection returned by `emptyRegionSnapshot()` and `emptyGlobal()`
   with one item.
2. Run the viewer's `buildIndex()` and take the distinct `kind` off the refs it
   produced.
3. Ask `ruleForKind()` about each; `coveredKinds()` is the same set from the
   other end.

Checked in both directions — `coveredKinds()` names no kind the viewer cannot
build, so a typo in a rule's `kinds` array cannot inflate the count.

### Kinds that resolve to nothing — 3

Each is deliberate. None is "we could not work it out", and all three still emit
a block — commented out, naming the kind — so a bulk copy cannot lose the
resource silently.

| kind | why there is no rule | what to do instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generic` | the Resource Groups Tagging API and Cloud Control sweeps (`collect/generic.ts`, `collect/cloudcontrol.ts`) merge into one collection spanning every service in the estate — the kind is a catch-all for hundreds of AWS types, so no single terraform type can be named for it | the block carries the ARN it was discovered by; read the service and resource out of that and use the rule for its real type |
| `ecr-registry` | `r/ecr_registry.html.markdown` is a **404**: the registry is an account-level singleton and the provider has no resource for it, only configuration attached to it | its three sub-resources do import, all three by the registry id — which is your account id: `aws_ecr_registry_policy`, `aws_ecr_registry_scanning_configuration`, `aws_ecr_replication_configuration` |
| `sso-instance` | `r/ssoadmin_instance.html.markdown` is a **404**: Identity Center instances are exposed as a **data source** only, `d/ssoadmin_instances` | reference it with `data "aws_ssoadmin_instances"` and feed its ARN into the resources that take `instance_arn` — `aws_ssoadmin_permission_set` and the two `aws_ssoadmin_*_attachment` types are covered below |

`generic` has no entry in a rule module at all; the other two are named in
`NO_RULE_KINDS` in `rules/scanned-workload.ts`, and
`test/scanned-workload.test.ts` asserts that list is exactly those two.

### The terraform type is chosen per resource — 8 kinds

`ImportRule.type` is a constant, and for these eight it is the merge key and
nothing else — one atlas kind covers several provider resources and a collected
field decides which. `typeFromScanned` reads that field and is **authoritative
including when it answers `undefined`**, at which point `from-scanned.ts` emits
no type at all rather than the dominant one.

| kind | discriminator | candidates | when it cannot tell |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `apigw` | `protocolType` | `aws_api_gateway_rest_api` (REST), `aws_apigatewayv2_api` (HTTP, WEBSOCKET) | id survives — both import by the bare API id |
| `apigw-vpc-link` | `version` | `aws_api_gateway_vpc_link` (v1), `aws_apigatewayv2_vpc_link` (v2) | id survives — both import by the bare link id |
| `apigw-domain` | `endpointTypes` | `aws_api_gateway_domain_name` (EDGE, PRIVATE), `aws_apigatewayv2_domain_name` | `REGIONAL` is valid on both, so the type is unknowable; the id (the domain name) survives. With **no** `endpointTypes` at all a private domain cannot be ruled out and the id is flagged too |
| `lb` | `lbType` | `aws_lb` (application, network, gateway), `aws_elb` (classic) | **id flagged as well** — `aws_lb` imports by ARN and `aws_elb` by name, so the variants disagree about the id, not just the type |
| `tgw-attachment` | `resourceType` | `aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment`, `_peering_attachment`, `aws_ec2_transit_gateway_connect` | id survives. `vpn` and `direct-connect-gateway` attachments have no attachment resource at all — they are created by `aws_vpn_connection` and `aws_dx_gateway_association` — so they decline here and stay declined |
| `dx-vif` | `vifType` | `aws_dx_private_virtual_interface`, `_public_`, `_transit_` | id survives — all three import by the same `dxvif-…` |
| `fsx` | `fileSystemType` | `aws_fsx_lustre_file_system`, `_windows_`, `_ontap_`, `_openzfs_` | id survives — all four import by the same `fs-…` |
| `datasync-location` | `locationType` | eleven `aws_datasync_location_*` types | **id flagged as well** — the eleven do not share one id form |

**The type and the id fail independently, and two kinds fail the other way
round** — type known, id not:

- `apigw-domain` with `PRIVATE` resolves to `aws_api_gateway_domain_name`, but a
  private custom domain imports by `<name>/<domain_name_id>` and `domainNameId`
  is not collected. Real `to =`, flagged id.
- The four FSx-backed `datasync-location` types resolve exactly, but import by
  `<location-arn>#<fsx-arn>` and the FSx ARN is not in the snapshot
  (`collect/datasync.ts` keeps only `SecurityGroupArns` from
  `DescribeLocationFsx*`). Nor can it be rebuilt from `locationUri`: the doc
  example puts the file system in a *different account*.

### Reading a commented-out block

A block with no type cannot be pasted, so the emitter comments the whole stanza
out rather than guessing at `to =`. This is what one looks like, and the comment
above it is the whole explanation — including whether the id is still good:

```hcl
# account 111122223333 · region eu-west-1
# VERIFY: the terraform resource type could not be determined — atlas kind "apigw-domain" covers several provider resources and the scanned fields do not identify one for this resource, so the block below is commented out. Candidates: aws_api_gateway_domain_name, aws_apigatewayv2_domain_name. The id below is right whichever of those it is
# import {
#   to = <replace with the terraform type and a name, e.g. aws_vpc.main>
#   id = "dev.example.com"
# }
```

Pick the candidate from the console or from what you know of the resource, put
it in `to =` with a name of your choosing, and uncomment. Where the id is also
flagged — the `lb` and `datasync-location` rows above — a second `VERIFY` line
says so, and that one you have to look up.

## Nested resources — one scanned parent, several import blocks

**A scanned resource is not always one terraform resource.** The snapshot nests
some relationships inside the resource they belong to — `SecurityGroup.ingress`
and `.egress` are the live case — while Terraform models each as a resource of
its own with its own import id. Nothing draws them on a graph, so they had
nothing to hang an import block on, and the result was a half-adoption that
looks complete: an `aws_security_group` block you can paste, and rules Terraform
still does not manage.

`resolveScannedExpanded(subject)` returns `{ parent, children }`;
`resolveScannedManyExpanded(subjects)` flattens for `emitBlocks`, **each parent
immediately followed by its own children** — that ordering is the contract, not
an implementation detail. `resolveScanned` is unchanged and never expands, so a
caller that wants one block per subject still gets exactly that.

**Only `sg` expands today.** `NetworkAcl.entries` and `RouteTable.routes` sit on
the same seam and are the obvious next two; nothing else is registered. A kind
with no expander returns no children, so callers can use the expanded form
unconditionally.

### The fan-out is not one child per source

One AWS `IpPermission` is **not** one rule resource per CIDR. From the provider
schema (`internal/service/ec2/vpc_security_group_rule.go`), `cidr_blocks` and
`ipv6_cidr_blocks` conflict with `source_security_group_id` and `self`, while
`prefix_list_ids` conflicts with nothing — so every CIDR-shaped source of one
permission belongs to a **single** resource carrying all of them, and each
referenced security group is a resource of its own.
`r/security_group_rule.html.markdown` documents exactly that with
`sg-4973616163_ingress_tcp_100_121_10.1.0.0/16_2001:db8::/48_…`. A permission
allowing three IPv4 ranges, an IPv6 range, a prefix list and one peer group is
therefore **two** blocks, not six.

### Why the emitted child type is the legacy one

`aws_security_group_rule` opens with `~> **NOTE:** Avoid using the
aws_security_group_rule resource`, recommending
`aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule` / `_egress_rule` instead. Those import by
`security_group_rule_id` — an `sgr-…` value that comes from
`DescribeSecurityGroupRules`, a call no collector in this repo makes and a field
the snapshot does not carry. Emitting a guessed `sgr-…` would be precisely the
confidently-wrong block this package exists to prevent, so the legacy composite
type — which composes exactly from fields the scan does hold — is the only
derivable one, and every child block says so rather than leaving the reader to
find out.

Every child block also carries the provider's `!> **WARNING:**`: combining
`aws_security_group_rule` with inline `ingress`/`egress` blocks on the
`aws_security_group`, or with the modern rule resources, "may cause rule
conflicts, perpetual differences, and result in rules being overwritten". That
is the one a reader genuinely needs, because these blocks ship **adjacent to an
`aws_security_group` block** — if the target configuration writes its rules
inline, pasting both is the documented way to lose rules. It stays on every
block: a `.tf` file is read with no UI around it.

A self-referencing rule names its own alternative rather than guessing. AWS
reports it as a `UserIdGroupPair` holding the group's own id, and
`expandIPPermission` issues the same API call for `self = true` and for
`source_security_group_id = <own id>` — a scan cannot tell which the
configuration used, so the id reports what AWS reported and the comment says how
to rewrite it.

### Writing an expander

The contract is in `ExpandedChild` in `src/types.ts`; read it first. In short:
**never throw and never drop** (a relationship you cannot express is a child with
`problem` set, which renders the stanza commented out — a dropped child is
invisible, and nothing in the UI would say it was ever considered); **one
relationship, one side**, because nothing detects a relationship registered on
both ends; and **scanned path only** — a state file already holds these as
first-class resources, so expanding there would emit every one of them twice.
`src/from-state.ts` does not import `src/from-scanned.ts`, and
`test/scanned-expand.test.ts` asserts it.

Expansion is one level: there are no grandchildren, an expander sees only its own
subject and cannot read the rest of the snapshot, and `import` blocks express no
ordering between children.

## Coverage — terraform types (from a state file)

215 terraform types: **211 resolve** and **4 carry an explicit not-importable
note**. Every format was read off
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/main/website/docs/r/<page>.html.markdown`
on 2026-08-07, and each rule records its page in `doc`.

> **Re-verifying:** those pages now print the `identity = { … }` form **first**
> and the `id = "…"` form second. This package emits the `id` form only
> (Terraform ≥ 1.5; the identity form needs ≥ 1.12 *and* a provider that
> publishes an identity schema for that resource, and coverage is uneven).
> Scroll past the first `import {` block or read the `terraform import` console
> line underneath it.

### Not importable — 4 types

These are not "we could not work it out". The provider publishes no import for
them. They still get a block, loudly flagged, so a state move cannot lose the
resource.

| type | what the provider says | what to do instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aws_autoscaling_attachment` | no `## Import` section on the page at all | re-declare the attachment in the target configuration and apply — it is a pure association, so creating it again is not destructive |
| `aws_iam_group_membership` | no `## Import` section on the page at all | `aws_iam_user_group_membership` *does* import (`user/group[/group…]`) and is the per-user replacement |
| `aws_vpn_connection_route` | no `## Import` section on the page at all | re-declare the static route in the target configuration and apply |
| `aws_vpn_gateway_attachment` | states it outright: "You cannot import this resource." | attach from the target configuration, or use `aws_vpn_gateway`'s own `vpc_id` argument |

### Deliberately not registered — 1 type

`aws_s3_object` has no rule **on purpose**. It is `awkward.expected.tf`'s
no-rule case, exercising both the `# VERIFY` fallback and the `${`/quote
escaping above. Registering a rule for it — here or in either scanned rule
module — silently invalidates a golden file that no package owns.
`test/state-rules.test.ts` asserts it stays ruleless.

### Composite ids — 68 types

The ones a naive generator gets wrong. Separators are not interchangeable:
EKS uses `:` where ECS uses `/`, Backup uses `|`, RAM uses `,`, and transit
gateway routes use `_`.

| type | import id |
| --- | --- |
| `aws_route` | `<route_table_id>_<destination>` — CIDR, IPv6 CIDR or prefix-list id |
| `aws_route_table_association` | `<subnet_id\|gateway_id>/<route_table_id>` |
| `aws_security_group_rule` | `<sg_id>_<type>_<protocol>_<from_port>_<to_port>_<source>[_<source>…]` |

| `aws_volume_attachment` | `<device_name>:<volume_id>:<instance_id>` |
| `aws_lb_listener_certificate` | `<listener_arn>_<certificate_arn>` |
| `aws_lb_target_group_attachment` | `<target_group_arn>,<target_id>[,<port>][,<availability_zone>]` |
| `aws_route53_record` | `<zone_id>_<name>_<type>[_<set_identifier>]` — an empty name gives `Z…__NS` |
| `aws_route53_zone_association` | `<zone_id>:<vpc_id>[:<vpc_region>]` |
| `aws_wafv2_web_acl` | `<id>/<name>/<scope>` — scope from the resource, never from region emptiness |
| `aws_wafv2_ip_set` | `<id>/<name>/<scope>` |
| `aws_wafv2_rule_group` | `<id>/<name>/<scope>` |
| `aws_wafv2_web_acl_association` | `<web_acl_arn>,<resource_arn>` |

| `aws_api_gateway_stage` | `<rest_api_id>/<stage_name>` |
| `aws_api_gateway_gateway_response` | `<rest_api_id>/<response_type>` |
| `aws_api_gateway_usage_plan_key` | `<usage_plan_id>/<key_id>` |
| `aws_api_gateway_method` | `<rest_api_id>/<resource_id>/<http_method>` |
| `aws_api_gateway_integration` | `<rest_api_id>/<resource_id>/<http_method>` |
| `aws_api_gateway_method_response` | `<rest_api_id>/<resource_id>/<http_method>/<status_code>` |
| `aws_api_gateway_integration_response` | `<rest_api_id>/<resource_id>/<http_method>/<status_code>` |
| `aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping` | `<domain_name>/<base_path>` — an empty base path leaves the trailing slash |
| `aws_apigatewayv2_route` | `<api_id>/<id>` |
| `aws_apigatewayv2_integration` | `<api_id>/<id>` |
| `aws_apigatewayv2_stage` | `<api_id>/<name>` |
| `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment` | `<role>/<policy_arn>` |
| `aws_iam_user_policy_attachment` | `<user>/<policy_arn>` |
| `aws_iam_group_policy_attachment` | `<group>/<policy_arn>` |
| `aws_iam_role_policy` | `<role>:<name>` — colon, not the attachment's slash |
| `aws_iam_user_policy` | `<user>:<name>` |
| `aws_iam_group_policy` | `<group>:<name>` |
| `aws_iam_user_group_membership` | `<user>/<group>[/<group>…]` |
| `aws_ssoadmin_permission_set` | `<arn>,<instance_arn>` |

| `aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration` | `<bucket>[,<expected_bucket_owner>]` |
| `aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration` | `<bucket>[,<expected_bucket_owner>]` |
| `aws_ecs_service` | `<cluster-name>/<service-name>` — **both halves derived**; see below |
| `aws_eks_node_group` | `<cluster_name>:<node_group_name>` — colon, not slash |

**`aws_ecs_service` is the one to watch.** The state id is the *service* ARN
(`ecs/service.go`: `SetId(Service.ServiceArn)`) and the `cluster` attribute is
the *cluster* ARN, so neither half of `prod-cluster/web` is present as written.
The rule takes the last segment of the cluster ARN, and when `cluster` is absent
falls back to the long-form service ARN `…:service/<cluster>/<service>`. The
pre-2019 short form `…:service/<service>` names no cluster, so it resolves to
`undefined` and a `# VERIFY` rather than a guessed `default`.

### One named attribute — 80 types

The import id is the documented attribute in parentheses, with the state `id` as
a fallback.

`aws_accessanalyzer_analyzer` (analyzer_name), `aws_acm_certificate` (arn),

(security_group_rule_id), `aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule`
(security_group_rule_id), `aws_wafv2_web_acl_logging_configuration` (resource_arn).

Note that `aws_iam_role`, `aws_iam_user`, `aws_iam_group` and
`aws_iam_instance_profile` import by **name** while `aws_iam_policy`,
`aws_iam_saml_provider` and `aws_iam_openid_connect_provider` import by **ARN**.
They are not the same rule.

`aws_eip` deserves a note of its own: the import id is the **allocation id**, so
the rule reads `allocation_id` rather than `id`. An EC2-Classic address whose id
is a bare public IP therefore cannot leak into the output.

## What a state file has that the fixture does not

`test/fixtures/awkward.tfstate.json` is synthetic, and every synthetic state is
tidier than a real one. Known gaps, so nobody has to rediscover them:

- **Deposed instances** are skipped and counted (`ParsedStateFile.skipped.deposed`).
  A `deposed` object is the old half of an interrupted create-before-destroy: it
  shares an address with the live instance and is scheduled for destruction, so
  importing it would both collide and adopt something Terraform is about to
  delete. The estate scanner's own state reader (`scanner/src/terraform.ts`,
  outside this repository) does **not** make this distinction — the divergence
  is deliberate, because that path is matching rather than importing.
- **Provider aliases** are mitigated by the `# account · region` comment, not
  solved. A state spanning two accounts is where a careless paste does damage.
- **Non-ASCII and shell-hostile names** are escaped where decision 9 covers them
  (`\`, `"`, `${`, `%{`) and not otherwise normalised.

## Adding a rule

1. Fetch
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/main/website/docs/r/<type_sans_aws_prefix>.html.markdown`.
   **Do not write an id format from memory** — a wrong one compiles, renders,
   copies to the clipboard, and fails hours later inside someone else's
   `terraform plan`, or worse succeeds against the wrong resource.
2. Read the `id = "…"` block, not the `identity = { … }` block above it.
3. Add the rule to the right module — `rules/state.ts` for `fromState`,
   `rules/scanned-network.ts` / `rules/scanned-workload.ts` for `fromScanned` —
   and set `doc` to the page. `rules/registry.ts` merges by type and needs no
   edit; if you think it does, the module boundary is wrong. The merge covers
   `expand` too, so a type declared in two modules keeps its expander whichever
   module declares it and whatever order `SOURCES` is in.
4. Add a case to that module's test. `test/state-rules.test.ts` asserts its case
   table is **complete**, so a resolver with no case fails the build.
5. If the type has no documented import, give it `notImportable` with a reason a
   user can act on — not silence, and not the generic fallback, which implies
   the id might work.

## Tests

```
npm test          # tsx --test "test/**/*.test.ts"
```

`node --test` through `tsx`, with no test framework (decision 12). Two nearby
invocations look equivalent and are not: `node --test --import tsx` does not
resolve the specifier, and `node --import tsx/esm --test` exits 1 on a
`{ todo: true }` failure, which would defeat a deliberately-red pin. Re-verify
that a todo failure still exits 0 if you change it.

| file | what it pins |
| --- | --- |
| `test/emit.test.ts` | escaping, address sanitising, collision dedupe, state parsing |
| `test/state-rules.test.ts` | every `fromState` resolver, and that the table is complete |
| `test/scanned-network.test.ts`, `test/scanned-workload.test.ts` | every `fromScanned` resolver |
| `test/scanned-expand.test.ts` | expansion: the fan-out rule, the provider notes, that the state path never expands, and that every declared expander survives the registry merge |
| `test/golden.test.ts` | the whole thing, both paths, and that they agree |

## Design decisions

Source comments, tests and fixtures in this package cite these **by number** —
64 citations across `src/`, `test/` and this file. They were taken while the
package was being built, and the numbering here matches the citations exactly:
`decision 9` in `emit.ts` is item 9 below.

They are not house style. Most of them encode a failure that is invisible at the
point you would make it and expensive later, in somebody else's `terraform
plan`. **Decisions 3 and 5 are the two a contributor is most likely to undo by
accident**, so they are written at length.

1. **Standalone, and free of its birth repository's types.** The package was
   written inside a private AWS estate scanner whose packages are named
   `@atlas/*`, and imports nothing from them — a constraint the source comments
   still name. See [Deliberately dependency-free](#deliberately-dependency-free),
   including the half of this decision that turned out to be wrong.

2. **A subject is structural, and declared here.** `ScannedSubject` is
   `{ kind, id, arn?, name?, region, accountId, raw }` (`src/types.ts`). A
   producer satisfies it by *shape* — the scanner's `ResourceRef` does, with no
   converter on either side — and the package never imports a producer's types.
   That is what keeps decision 1 true, and it is why your own inventory records
   can drive this package as long as they can be described that way.

3. **Emit the `id = "…"` form only. Read ids off the `id` block, never the
   `identity` block.**

   Terraform's `import` block has taken a string `id` since 1.5. The
   `identity = { … }` form needs Terraform **1.12 or newer** *and* a provider
   that publishes a resource identity schema for that specific type; coverage
   across the AWS provider is uneven, so supporting it would mean tracking, per
   type, whether an identity schema exists — a second rule table that goes stale
   silently. This package emits `id` and nothing else. Do not "upgrade" it
   without asking.

   The consequence is a trap for anyone adding or re-verifying a rule, and it is
   the reason so many source comments repeat it. **The AWS provider's
   documentation pages now print the `identity = { … }` example first**, above
   the `id = "…"` example. The first `import {` block your eye lands on is
   therefore the wrong one. Every id format in `src/rules/` was taken from the
   `id = "…"` block further down the page, or from the `terraform import`
   console line beneath it. Copying the top stanza gives you an identity map for
   a consumer on Terraform 1.5 — it will not parse — and, worse, an identity
   map's *attribute set* is often not the same information as the id string, so
   the mistake does not always announce itself as a syntax error. **Scroll past
   the first `import {`.**

4. **Rule coverage is the union of two tiers, and neither contains the other.**
   Tier A is the kinds a graph viewer can build, needed to answer "what do I
   paste for this thing I can see?". Tier B is the composite and attachment
   types that dominate a real state file and are never drawn. The two overlap in
   105 terraform types; 31 rules are scanned-only. A "complete" table that
   covers one tier is half a table.

5. **A guard returns `undefined` and earns a `# VERIFY`. It never returns a
   plausible wrong answer.**

   Nothing is ever dropped. A type with no rule still produces a block, built
   from the state's own `id` and flagged `# VERIFY: no rule for <type> — import
   id may not be the state id`. A rule that *exists* but cannot compute an id
   from the fields it was given does the same thing: the resolver returns
   `undefined`, and the block says so. `ResolvedImport.verified` is how a caller
   tells the two apart.

   The reasoning is asymmetric, and it is the whole reason this package exists.
   Three outcomes are possible for a resource this code is unsure about:

   - **Dropped silently** — the worst. During a state move, a resource missing
     from the import blocks is a resource the new configuration does not manage
     and the old state no longer protects. You find out when something destroys
     it.
   - **Wrong, and flagged** — recoverable in seconds. `# VERIFY` puts the doubt
     in front of the person who can settle it, on the line above the id.
   - **Wrong, and unflagged** — worse than both. It compiles, it renders, it
     copies to the clipboard, and it fails hours later inside somebody else's
     `terraform plan`. Or it succeeds, against the wrong resource.

   **So if you are reading this because a guard returned `undefined` and you
   wanted the id anyway: do not turn the guard into a passthrough.** The worked
   example is `aws_eip`. EC2-Classic elastic IPs carry a bare IP address as
   their id, and `aws_eip` imports by *allocation* id — so a bare-IP subject
   resolves to no rule, deliberately. `id = "203.0.113.5"` is not a near miss
   that a user can fix up; it is an import that fails, or adopts something else.
   The correct fix is a rule that can compute the right id, or the `# VERIFY`.
   The same holds in a UI: show the flagged block and say why, rather than
   hiding the section and looking tidy.

6. **Only identifiers leave the state file.** Rules may *read* any attribute to
   compute an import id. What is written out is the computed id, the Terraform
   address, and the account and region the resource's own ARN disclosed —
   nothing else. No attribute value is ever copied into output unless it *is*
   the import id. Reading a state to generate import blocks does not put state
   values in the generated `.tf`, and that property is worth preserving on
   purpose: state files hold secrets.

7. **Generated `.tf` goes where the caller says.** The package returns strings
   and writes no files. There is no default output path and nothing is ever
   written beside the state file it read — import blocks belong in the *target*
   configuration's repository, not next to the source of truth you are moving
   away from.

8. **A synthesised address is a suggestion, and collisions are deduped.** From a
   state file the address is authoritative; it came from the state. From a
   scanned resource there is no address, so `<tf_type>.<sanitised name or id>`
   is synthesised and `addressIsSuggestion` is set — a UI should say it is a
   suggestion to rename. Sanitising follows HCL: identifiers match
   `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_-]*`, so invalid characters become `_` and a result
   starting with a digit gets an `r_` prefix. Within a single emit, collisions
   take `_2`, `_3` — two unmanaged security groups both named `default` must not
   both become `aws_security_group.default`, because the second one silently
   replaces the first in the file you paste.

9. **HCL escaping is the emitter's job and is not optional.** `\` → `\\`,
   `"` → `\"`, `${` → `$${`, `%{` → `%%{`. An unescaped `${` is *interpolated*
   by Terraform at parse time, so an id containing one becomes a different id or
   an error. This is not hypothetical tidiness: S3 keys, tag values and Route 53
   record names all carry these characters in the wild.

10. **No `provider =` argument. A `# account · region` comment instead.** We
    cannot know a caller's provider alias names, and importing into the wrong
    provider is silent and expensive. Every block therefore carries
    `# account <id> · region <region>` above it. This is also the only advice
    that is correct in both positions: Terraform *rejects* a `provider` argument
    outright when the `to` address is inside a module, and directs you to the
    module block's `providers` map instead — so an emitted `provider =` would be
    wrong or unusable depending on where the resource lands.

11. **Data sources and non-`aws_` resources are skipped.** A `data` block has no
    import, and a resource from another provider is outside this package's rule
    table. Both are common in a real state, and both are counted rather than
    ignored, so a caller can reconcile the block count against the state.

12. **The test runner is `node --test` through `tsx`.** No test framework, no
    assertion library, no new dependency in the runtime graph. Verified
    behaviour that is load bearing: a failing assertion under `{ todo: true }`
    prints the full diff and still exits 0, which is what lets a deliberately
    red pin sit in a green tree. See [Tests](#tests) for the two nearby
    invocations that break it.

13. **No runtime dependencies. Not an HCL library, not a YAML parser.** The
    emitter is string building, and the rule table is data. This is a
    constraint on the package, not an accident of its current size.

14. **The package is additive: it never asked the scanner for a new field.** It
    was built as a second, independent path beside an existing Terraform
    matching feature and changed nothing about it. In practice the citations of
    this decision all mean one thing — **a rule may not require a snapshot field
    that is not already collected**, because adopting drift must not have
    "re-scan the whole estate" as a prerequisite. `aws_sqs_queue` is the
    positive case: the queue URL is *derived* from the ARN the scanner already
    stores. The FSx-backed DataSync locations are the negative one: their id
    needs an ARN nobody collected and which cannot be rebuilt (the provider's
    own example puts the FSx file system in a different account), so the rule
    declines rather than guessing — decision 5 again.

The per-type import-id rule table in `src/rules/` was derived by reading the
"Import" section of roughly 250 resource documentation pages in

and in about a dozen cases the provider's Go source where the documentation was
ambiguous or wrong — `internal/service/ec2/vpc_security_group_rule.go` and
`internal/service/ec2/vpc_security_group.go` most of all. The state-file
formats and the `import` block's own validation rules were checked against
[`hashicorp/terraform`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) itself
